.SH NAME

simple_shell \- run a basic shell. Command interpreter.

.SH SYNOPSIS

   #include <stdio.h>

   #include <stdlib.h>

   #include <sys/types.h>

   #include <sys/wait.h>

   #include <string.h>



   int main(int ac, char *av[], char **env);



   where ac is an unussed variable, av is the content of the argument and env is the evironment of the program.



.SH DESCRIPTION

    simple_shell is the standard command interpreter for the system. It is a program that runs a basic shell.
Display a prompt and wait for the user to type a command. A command line always ends with a new line.

    The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.

    The command lines are simple, no semicolons, no pipes, no redirections or any other advanced features.

    It handles arguments with the commands.

    The simple_shell shows error messages when a typing error occurs.

.SH OPTIONS

    Simple Shell manges to be executed. The interactive and non-interactive. The second one is for look the results outside t    he program.

    All the commands has its own flags and options and this version manage the path of the directory where we need to use the 	 command.

BUILT-INS

	exit and env.

.SH EXIT STATUS

     Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to

     exit with a non-zero exit status.  If the shell is not an interactive shell, the execu-

     tion of the shell file will be aborted.  Otherwise the shell will return the exit status

     of the last command executed, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it

     will return the argument.



.SH ENVIRONMENT



    LESSOPEN	this variable is to tell the less program how to guess and read different types of files. In principle, less                 read just ASCII files, so a command like less package.tar will produce an error. The "old" way to do is was t                o untar the file package.tar and pipe the result to less, so we just see the list of files in the package.tar                archive.



    MAIL	The name of a mail file, that will be checked for the arrival of new mail.  Overridden by

                MAILPATH.



    SSH_CLIENT	The SSH client's IP address, followed by space, followed by port number. The SSH Server does set this for com                mands executed in service context.



    USER	the SSH Server sets this to the account name portion (without domain) of the user's full account name. The SS		     H Server does not set this for commands executed in service context.



    SHLVL	holds the number of shell levels the current shell is running on top of. In a new terminal window, executing 		     the following command will produce different results based on the Linux distribution in use.



    LD_LIBRARY_PATH   is a colon-separated (:) set of directories where libraries are searched for first before the standard 		     	 	   set of directories.



    HOME       Set automatically by login(1) from the user's login directory in the password file

                (passwd(4)).  This environment variable also functions as the default argument for the cd

                builtin.

    OLDPWD     The previous logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the cd com-

                mand.



    SSH_TTY	specifies the device node of the current virtual terminal (e.g. /dev/pts/25 ). The SSH_CONNECTION is set to i                p and port on client and on host machine (4 fields separated by whitespace)



    LC_CTYPE	are special environment variables which after they got exported to the shell environment ( help export ), the		     y are available and ready to be read by certain programs which supports a locale (natural language formatting                for C).



    LOGNAME	Login name.



    _		the command line of the last command executed.



    XDG_SESSION_ID



    TERM       The default terminal setting for the shell.  This is inherited by children of the shell,

                and is used in the history editing modes.



    PATH       The default search path for executables.  See the above section Path Search.



    XDG_RUNTIME_DIR



    GLIBCPP_FORCE_NEW



    LANG	or specifying a locale. As a user, you normally set this variable (unless some of the other variables have al                ready been set by the system, in /etc/profile or similar initialization files).

LS_COLORS	is responsible for the colors that you see when you run the ls command.
SHELL	contains the path of the shell.



    LESSCLOSE



    PWD        The logical value of the current working directory.  This is set by the cd command.



    SSH_CONNECTION shows the address of the client, the outgoing port on the client, the address of the server and the incomi                   ng port on the server



    GLIBCXX_FORCE_NEW



    LD_PRELOAD	containing one or more paths to shared libraries, or shared objects, that the loader will load before any oth                er shared library including the C runtime library (libc.so)
